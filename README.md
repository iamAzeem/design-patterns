# Design Patterns

Just trying to understand and implement different design patterns in C++. ;)   
I'd try to write code samples to demonstrate the heap and stack usages.   

All classes (patterns) are enclosed in `DP` namespace.

Any kind of help and positive criticism for improvement is welcome! :)
